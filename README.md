# RPG-DAD_BOD
---
This was a project created for CSCI-40 at Clovis Community College for the Fall semester of 2022. It was created as a group by four of us, and we had 10 days to create an RPG game.
## Design Criteria
Here are the Criteria that we followed.
### Required
1. World Map that the user can move around.
2. Combat of some sort, and some way of winning the game
3. Must have colors (use provided `colors.h` will include at a later date)
4. Must have **5** puzzles to win the game
5. **40** lines of dialogue and/or descriptions of the world
---
### Extra Credit
---
1. Nonblocking I/O (also in colors.h)
2. Compose Original Music and Cover Art [Link to ours](https://youtu.be/tX7EOyNQvKY)
3. Inventory System
We were able to accomplish all of the above!

## Will add code breakdown at a later date.
